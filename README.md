# Principles-of-Programming-Languages
School Projects from the course I took during my degree (Principles of Programming Languages)

autodiff.rkt was a hands-on experience for me to grasp the "functional programming" concept.

solution.pl was a completely opposite experience. It helped me grasped the "logic programming" concept although it was a weird first experience since the language lacked the
full requirements of a logic language.
